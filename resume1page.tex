\textbf{Homomorphic Encryption Over Vectors with application to SCM -} \emph{M.Tech. Thesis}\hfill[Autumn 2015 - present]
\emph{Guide: Prof. Bernard Menezes}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
 \item Implement Zhou's scheme for efficient homomorphic encryption over 
integer vectors and improve performance by making use of multiple cores and multiprocessing.
 \item Apply the above solution to predict inventory needs based past data which would be homomorphically encrypted.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Homomorphic Cryptography -} \emph{M.Tech. Seminar}\hfill[Spring 2014]
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
 \item Survey various techniques that allow homomorphic encryption of data fully or partially. The relative efficacy of the techniques and the practicality of the implementation was also researched.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Cloud based memcache clone -} \emph{Course Project}\hfill[Spring 2014]
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
 \item Goal: 5 servers maintain a replicated memcache table. The servers are cemented together with a RAFT based consensus algorithm. Built using golang.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Emotion detection from live chat -} \emph{Course Project}\hfill[Autumn 2014]
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
 \item Goal: Develop a system to analyze data from a text based chat, and as an output display the predicted emotion portrayed. This was a python based project in which we extensively used the nltk library.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{QT based SpecRTL  visualizer -} \emph{Course Project}\hfill[Spring 2013]
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
 \item SpecRTL is an easy to write yet difficult to visualize machine description language. A Qt based tool was developed which takes as input the specRTL code and produces a tree based graphic output.
\end{itemize}
